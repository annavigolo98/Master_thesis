# masterthesisprograms

#Programs used for target analysis for the 14N(p,g)15O reaction studied in my master thesis and for the LUNA experiment to be performed in 2022-2023 at Gran Sasso National Laboratories.
#1) Simulation to calculate the yield profile (integral of the cross section over the effective stoppping power between two energy values) starting from the target composition: number of layers,
#thickness in atoms/cm^2, percentages of nitrogen and tantalum in each layer. The cross section is calculated apart from a normalization constant (to be fitted). 
#2) Program to add beam straggling effects by convolution of the yield values with a gaussian function.
